# My CSS Basics & Box Model Assignment

## About
This is my CSS assignment.  
I made a simple web page about me and styled it with CSS.  
I used the Box Model (margin, padding, border) to make it look nice.

## Files
- **index.html** → my web page content  
- **styles.css** → all my CSS styling

## What I Learned
- How to link CSS to HTML
- How to change text color and size
- How to add background colors
- How to use margin, padding, and border
- How to make boxes (cards) with shadow
- How to style a header and footer

## Box Model in My Page
- **Margin** → space outside the boxes
- **Padding** → space inside the boxes
- **Border** → lines around the boxes
- **Content** → the text inside the boxes

## How to View
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Make sure `styles.css` is in the same folder
3. Refresh to see changes when editing CSS
